# Two-pass-assembler
Developed a two-pass assembler and an emulator in C++ to process and execute a custom assembly language. The assembler converts assembly code into machine code while detecting syntax and logical errors, and the emulator executes the generated binary code while simulating registers, memory, and program control flow
